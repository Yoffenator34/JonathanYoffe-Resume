        <div class="subheading mb-5">Medical Sales Representative</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jonathan Yoffe and I am a second-year 
        student and currently attending UC Riverside. I am currently majoring in 
        Political Science and am striving to graduate and earn my BA in three
        years.
        
        Although I am not a current member of any fraternities or clubs on campus, I recently 
        accepted an internship at Cleartron Inc. With this internship, I will be trained and
        mentored in the medical sales industry as a representative. The ultimate outcome from
        this experience will be for me to contact executives in various deparmtents and 
        educate them into understanding why Cleartron sells the most efficient medical
        instruments on the market to date. Qualifications for this opportunity included a 
        basic comprehension on how to utilize Excel. 
        
        Before this internship, most of my job experience was within the fast food industry.
        When i acquired my first job at sixteen years old, I worked at Subway. After a brutal
        three months of working with no training, no help and additional issues, I realized
        that I could find another job that was more worth my time for only minimum wqge.
        
        The summer right before senior year of high school, I started a new job at 
        McDonald's. Although McDonald's was most definetly an improvement from Subway, the job
        consisted of many problems that I found similar to Subway. After nine months of working
        there, practically my entire senior year, I decided to quit and find a new job for the 
        summer before entering UCR. 
        
        During that summer, my stepdad connected me with one of his old coworkers who owns his
        own HVAC shop, leading me to become an HVAC Technician for the summer. Although I had
        never had a job that required constant physical exertion, full-time schedule, and had
        never driven a van before, I was excited for the work. I grew tired of the fast food
        industry, for schedules were never consistent, managers were lazy and requests were 
        never fulfilled. 
        
        As an HVAC Technician, I learned many skills including: the HVAC blueprint of houses,
        how to install AC units, heaters, and ventilation units. Furthermore, I was tasked 
        with the responsibility of always driving to stores and picking up whatever parts
        that were relative to each specific job. In my opinion, the biggest perk of this job 
        was being able to eat lunch wherever we wanted. But all good things must come to an 
        end.
        
        The following summer, after my first year at UC Riverside, I worked at a salad place
        called Sweetgreen. Parallel to my work history at fast food locations, the management 
        was unresponsive to problems in the work place and overall ignorant. 
        
        Academically, I am pursuing a BA in political science and aim to graduate at the age
        of twenty years old. After I earn my degree, I plan on entering a training program
        at Stryker to become an official medical sales representative. Although this is a 
        current goal of mine, my life is still young, and only the future holds my destiny. 
        If interested, bling my line at anytime, all is fine.
